                     li: p Parking terminals are often the direct link between a motorist and a parking system. Tough and reliable, PDM terminals can withstand virtually any environment and are fully customizable. 

                     li: p A single Pay and Display pay station is capable of managing multiple spaces in a typical city street. PDK, "Parking machine with Keyboard" pay stations can manage on average between 10 to 75 spaces, depending on the configuration of the area. Once parked, the user approaches the Pay & Display pay station and, using coins, cards or banknotes, pays for the required parking period. 

                     li: p Pay and display systems differ from roadside pay stations in that one pay station can service multiple vehicle spaces, resulting in lower set up costs. In addition, this system prevents drivers from taking advantage of pay stations that have time remaining â€“ this factor alone has doubled parking revenues in cities that have switched to pay and display.
